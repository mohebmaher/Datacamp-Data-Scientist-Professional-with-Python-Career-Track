    "**scikit-learn requirements**\n",
    "> - Recall that **scikit-learn requires numeric data, with no missing values**.\n",
    "> - All the data that we have used so far has been in this format.\n",
    "> - However, with **real-world data**, this will rarely be the case, and instead **we need to preprocess our data before we can build models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing with categorical features**\n",
    "> - Say we have a dataset containing **categorical features**, such as color.\n",
    "> - As these are not numeric, **scikit-learn will not accept them** and we need to convert them into **numeric features**.\n",
    "> - We achieve this by **splitting the feature into multiple binary features called dummy variables**, one for each category.\n",
    "> - **`0`** means the observation was **not that category**, while **`1`** means **it was**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dummy variables**\n",
    "> - Say we are working with a music dataset that has a genre feature with 10 values such as Electronic, Hip-Hop, and Rock.\n",
    "> - We create **binary features** for each genre.\n",
    "> - As each song has one genre, **each row will have a `1` in one of the 10 columns** and `0` in the rest.\n",
    "> - If a song is not any of the first nine genres, **then implicitly, it is a rock song**.\n",

    "**Dummy variables**\n",
    "> - That means **we only need nine features, so we can delete the Rock column**.\n",
    "> - If we do not do this, **we are duplicating information, which might be an issue for some models**.\n",

    "**Music dataset**\n",
    "> - We will be working with a **music dataset** in this chapter, for both **classification** and **regression** problems.\n",
    "> - Initially, we will build a **regression model** using all features in the dataset to **predict song `popularity`**.\n",
    "> - There is one categorical feature, **`genre`**, with **ten possible values**.\n",

    "**Encoding dummy variables**\n",
    "> - We **import** pandas, **read** in the DataFrame, and **call** `pd.get_dummies()`, **passing** the categorical column.\n",
    "> - As we only need to keep 9 out of our 10 binary features, we can **set** the `drop_first` argument to `True`.\n",
    "> - Printing the first five rows, we see **pandas creates 9 new binary features**.\n",
    "> - The first song is Jazz, and the second is Rap, indicated by a `1` in the respective columns.\n",
    "> - To bring these binary features back into our original DataFrame we can **use** `pd.concat()`, **passing** a list containing the `music_df` DataFrame and our `music_dummies` DataFrame, and setting `axis` equal to `1`.\n",
    "> - Lastly, we can **remove** the original `genre` column using `.drop()`, **passing(()) the column, and setting `axis` equal to `1`.\n",

    "**Encoding dummy variables**\n",
    "> - If the DataFrame only has one categorical feature, we can **pass** the entire DataFrame, thus skipping the step of combining variables.\n",
    "> - If we **don't specify a column**, the new DataFrame's binary columns will have the original feature name **prefixed**, so they will start with genre-underscore - as shown here.\n",
    "> - Notice the original genre column is **automatically dropped**.\n",
    "> - Once we have dummy variables, we can **fit** models as before.\n",

    "**Linear regression with dummy variables**\n",
    "> - Using the `music_dummies` DataFrame, the process for creating **training** and **test sets** remains unchanged.\n",
    "> - To perform **cross-validation** we then **create** a `KFold()` object, **instantiate** a linear regression model, and **call** `cross_val_score()`.\n",
    "> - We **set** scoring equal to `neg_mean_squared_error`, which **returns the negative MSE**.\n",
    "> - This is because scikit-learn's cross-validation metrics presume a **higher score is better**, so **MSE** is changed to **negative MSE** to counteract this.\n",
    "> - We can **calculate** the training RMSE by **taking the square root and converting to positive**, achieved by **calling** `numpy.square-root()` and **passing** our scores with a **minus sign** in front.\n",
