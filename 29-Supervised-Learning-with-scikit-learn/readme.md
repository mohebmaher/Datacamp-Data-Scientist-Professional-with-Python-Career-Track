#### INTERACTIVE COURSE
# [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn)

## Course Description
> Grow your machine learning skills with scikit-learn and discover how to use this popular Python library to train models using labeled data. In this course, you'll learn how to make powerful predictions, such as whether a customer is will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, and even how to tell classify the genre of a song. Using real-world datasets, you'll find out how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data.

### Classification
> In this chapter, you'll be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. You'll learn how to split data into training and test sets, fit a model, make predictions, and evaluate accuracy. Youâ€™ll discover the relationship between model complexity and performance, applying what you learn to a churn dataset, where you will classify the churn status of a telecom company's customers.

### Regression
> In this chapter, you will be introduced to regression, and build models to predict sales values using a dataset on advertising expenditure. You will learn about the mechanics of linear regression and common performance metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error. You will perform k-fold cross-validation, and apply regularization to regression models to reduce the risk of overfitting.

### Fine-Tuning Your Model
> Having trained models, now you will learn how to evaluate them. In this chapter, you will be introduced to several metrics along with a visualization technique for analyzing classification model performance using scikit-learn. You will also learn how to optimize classification and regression models through the use of hyperparameter tuning.

### Preprocessing and Pipelines
> Learn how to impute missing values, convert categorical data to numeric values, scale data, evaluate multiple supervised learning models simultaneously, and build pipelines to streamline your workflow!
