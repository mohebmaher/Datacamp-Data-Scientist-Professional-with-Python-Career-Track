    "**What is machine learning?**\n",
    "> - Machine learning is the process whereby computers learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of machine learning**\n",
    "> - For example, learning to predict whether an email is spam or not spam given its content and sender.\n",
    "> - Or learning to cluster books into different categories based on the words they contain, then assigning any new book to one of the existing clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    "> - Unsupervised learning is the process of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data.\n",
    "> - For example, a business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories are.\n",
    "> - This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/ch01_01_ml_with_scikit_learn_img01.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    "> - Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the values to be predicted are already known, and a model is built with the aim of accurately predicting values of previously unseen data.\n",
    "> - Supervised learning uses features to predict the value of a target variable, such as predicting a basketball player's position based on their points per game.\n",
    "> - This course will exclusively focus on supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/ch01_01_ml_with_scikit_learn_img02.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of supervised learning**\n",
    "> - There are two types of supervised learning:\n",
    "> 1. Classification is used to predict the label, or category, of an observation.\n",
    ">> - For example, we can predict whether a bank transaction is fraudulent or not.\n",
    ">> - As there are two outcomes here - a fraudulent transaction, or non-fraudulent transaction, this is known as binary classification.\n",
    "> 2. Regression is used to predict continuous values.\n",
    ">> - For example, a model can use features such as number of bedrooms, and the size of a property, to predict the target variable, price of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming conventions**\n",
    "> - Note that what we call a feature throughout the course, others may call a predictor variable or independent variable.\n",
    "> - Also, what we call the target variable, others may call dependent variable or response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you use supervised learning**\n",
    "> - There are some requirements to satisfy before performing supervised learning:\n",
    ">> - Our data must not have missing values,\n",
    ">> - Our data must be in numeric format,\n",
    ">> - Our data is stored as pandas DataFrames or Series, or NumPy arrays.\n",
    "> - This requires some exploratory data analysis first to ensure data is in the correct format.\n",
    "> - Various pandas methods for descriptive statistics, along with appropriate data visualizations, are useful in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**scikit-learn syntax**\n",
    "> - scikit-learn follows the same syntax for all supervised learning models, which makes the workflow repeatable.\n",
    "> - Let's familiarize ourselves with the general scikit-learn workflow syntax, before we explore using real data later in the chapter:\n",
    ">> - We import a `Model`, which is a type of algorithm for our supervised learning problem, from an `sklearn` module.\n",
    ">>> - For example, the k-Nearest Neighbors model uses distance between observations to predict labels or values.\n",
    ">> - We create a variable named `model`, and instantiate the `Model`.\n",
    ">> - A `model` is fit to the data, where it learns patterns about the features and the target variable.\n",
    ">>> - We fit the model to `X`, an array of our features, and `y`, an array of our target variable values.\n",
    ">> - We then use the `model`'s `.predict()` method, passing six new observations, `X_new`.\n",
    ">>> - For example, if feeding features from six emails to a spam classification model, an array of six values is returned.\n",
    ">>> - A `1` indicates the model predicts that email is spam, and a `0` represents a prediction of not spam.\n",
